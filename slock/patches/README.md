These are the patches I applied to slock:

-> Caps color

-> Message

You can add any other patch you like by downloading a patch from https://tools.suckless.org/slock/patches, 
then place the patch in the same directory as slock, then run `patch < slock-patch-goes-here.diff`.

After you're done adding a patch, run `make clean; sudo make install`.
